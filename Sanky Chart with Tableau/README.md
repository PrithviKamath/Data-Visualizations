# Tableau Visualization on superstore dataset
</br  >
<b>Dataset Overview</b>: </br  >
Sample Superstore dataset is a dataset shared on the Tableau Community Forums. It was created by Michael Martin on Dec 8, 2012 12:23 PM and last modified by Patrick A Van Der Hyde Employee on Nov 28, 2017 1:32 PM. It contains order details about an imaginary store that sells office supplies, furniture and technology to customers across multiple regions in the United States. I have visualized the shipment mode for all product categories using a sanky chart in tableau.
