<b>Conclusion</b>: We observe that the maximum number of malaria cases are reported from the southern districts of Sinazongwe with 1,58,847 cases, followed by Gwembe which reported 64,059 cases over 5 years. Proximity to lake Kariba could be a possible reason as Malaria is a water borne disease.</br >

<b>Conclusion</b>: We observe that the number of reported cases were very high in 2014 and have substancially reduced over the years. Based on the trend we can forecast that March 2018 could possible again a rise in the cases and the count could be 17,292.</br >
